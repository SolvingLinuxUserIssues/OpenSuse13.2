I tried to install ffmpeg , I could not find it in the repositories for opensuse13.2 ,so I went to the project page
https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
and downloaded the ffmpeg-2.8.6.tar.bz2 file , putting it into my Downloads folder.
I then uncompressed it , and cd into the new directory ffmpeg-2.8.6
The basic instructions are in the file INSTALL.md and what it says there is basically to do :
  ./configure
  make
  make install  (in reality , this is not enough , needs root privileges,or sudo)
So I did (while I was still in my Downloads/ffmpeg-2.8.6 folder) the ./configure first ,  
and I got a message about missing some yasm or nasm assembly package. 
I installed the yasm , and to be more sure , I also installed the yasm-devel (may not be necessary)
  sudo zypper install yasm yasm-devel
This time I had no error messages from 
  ./configure
so I moved on to do the make , it took several minutes , lots of output on the screen , but nothing seemd to cause
any serious concerns.
The next step should be performed with sudo 
  sudo make install
and again lots of output , and nothing to prepare me for any problems.
So when it finished , I searched with 
  ls -ls /usr/local/bin/ff*
but I only had ffmpeg , ffprobe and ffserver ! Where was ffplay? 
I started googling , found some artivces mentining something about sdl libraries , but nothing for opensuse.
Using zypper again I did 
  sudo zypper install libsdl-devel
just in case this was needed , and tried again the 3 steps (configure , make , sudo make install)
but still no ffplay! 
I could see in the results of the articles that they were about ubuntu or macOSX etc , so I did not bother 
to read all these stuff. So I opened shell script file configure , to see its contents.
After spending some time getting familiar with some variables related to ffplay , I changed the line
  SDL_CONFIG="${cross_prefix}sdl-config"
with 
  SDL_CONFIG="/usr/bin/sdl-config"
and it solved my problems. 
I did not want to do 
  ./configure --cross-prefix=/usr/bin
because then the variable ${cross_prefix} would be "/usr/lib" in all places it appears ,
and this ${cross_prefix} appears in so many places in the configure script , that I was afraid it will 
destroy all other variables ,like ar_default , cc_default , pkg_config_default etc (that did not complain anyway).
So I do not know exactly why the configure script could not prepend the /usr/bin for the sdl-config , while 
it was successfull for ar_default , cc_default , pkg_config_default etc , but I do not want to spend more 
time in this now! I finally have ffplay , and now must learn how to use it.
