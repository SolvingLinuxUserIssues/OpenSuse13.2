I tried to install ffmpeg , I could not find it in the repositories for opensuse13.2 ,so I went to the project page
https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
and downloaded the ffmpeg-2.8.6.tar.bz2 file , putting it into my Downloads folder.
I then uncompressed it , and cd into the new directory ffmpeg-2.8.6
The basic instructions are in the file INSTALL.md
